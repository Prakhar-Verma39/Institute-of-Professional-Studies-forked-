### Rules

<ul>
    <li>Follow MVC pattern only.<br/>
        <p> 
            <b>In short : </b><br/>
            <b>Model:</b> Model represents the structure of data, the format and the constraints with which it is stored. It maintains the data of the application. Essentially, it is the database part of the application.<br/> 
            <b>View:</b> View is what is presented to the user. Views utilize the Model and present data in a form in which the user wants. A user can also be allowed to make changes to the data presented to the user. They consist of static and dynamic pages which are rendered or sent to the user when the user requests them.<br/> 
            <b>Controller:</b> Controller controls the requests of the user and then generates appropriate response which is fed to the viewer. Typically, the user interacts with the View, which in turn generates the appropriate request, this request will be handled by a controller.<br/>
            The controller renders the appropriate view with the model data as a response. So, to sum it up:
                <ol>
                    <li><i>Model</i> is data part.</li>
                    <li><i>View</i> is User Interface part.</li>
                    <li><i>Controller</i> is request-response handler.</li>
                </ol>

### Guidelines

<ul>
    <li>Clear institute name on every page( including on footer)</li>
    <li>Realistic photos and images (e.g., Information-Carrying Images , not portraits or static images )</li>
    <li>About us page must be informative( plain language ,an easy-to-scan fact list or a short video)</li>
    <li>Avoid long dense paragraphs</li>
    <li>Rankings, Ratings, etc can be lower down as long as they are easy to see when scanning the page</li>
    <li>Make it easy for users to view a list of majors and programs. It would be better to place a link to view the degrees and majors within this main section</li>
    <li>try to offer the option to view all the majors and programs. </li>
    <li>Alumni page, Universities should provide data about what graduates are doing after college, with numbers and sources to support those claims. (<i>At the very least, make job placement data available from the university’s About Us, Admissions, and/or Career Center pages, with a link from the Alumni section</i>)</li>
    <li>Clearly show the application deadlines, and offer a step-by-step description of the application process(<b>Depending on the structure of your site, place the dates in the body of the Admissions or Apply (or equivalent) page. If there are multiple or complicated deadlines, consider a dedicated Deadlines page in that section. Either way, make sure it’s clearly labeled and easy to spot.</b>)</li>
    <li>Follow the user journey:user-centered design (UCD)(e.g., personas creation).
    By testing with just 5 users, you can uncover 85% of the issues</li>
    <li>Don't make the website too flashy.</li>
    <li>Compare with other external websites which offer details handy.(e.g., competitive websites)</li>
</ul>
