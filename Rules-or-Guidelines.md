### Guidelines

<ul>
  <li>Clear institute name on every page( including on footer)</li>
  <li>Realistic photos and images (e.g., Information-Carrying Images , not portraits or static images )</li>
  <li>About us page must be informative( plain language ,an easy-to-scan fact list or a short video)</li>
  <li>Avoid long dense paragraphs</li>
  <li>Rankings, Ratings, etc can be lower down as long as they are easy to see when scanning the page</li>
  <li>Make it easy for users to view a list of majors and programs. It would be better to place a link to view the degrees and majors within this main section</li>
  <li>try to offer the option to view all the majors and programs. </li>
  <li>Alumni page, Universities should provide data about what graduates are doing after college, with numbers and sources to support those claims. (<i>At the very least, make job placement data available from the university’s About Us, Admissions, and/or Career Center pages, with a link from the Alumni section</i>)</li>
  <li>Clearly show the application deadlines, and offer a step-by-step description of the application process(<b>Depending on the structure of your site, place the dates in the body of the Admissions or Apply (or equivalent) page. If there are multiple or complicated deadlines, consider a dedicated Deadlines page in that section. Either way, make sure it’s clearly labeled and easy to spot.</b>)</li>
  <li>Follow the user journey:user-centered design (UCD)(e.g., personas creation).
  By testing with just 5 users, you can uncover 85% of the issues</li>
  <li>Don't make the website too flashy.</li>
  <li>Compare with other external websites which offer details handy.(e.g., competitive websites)</li>
